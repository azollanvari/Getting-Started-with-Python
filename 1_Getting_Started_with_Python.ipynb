    "\n",
    "This is the first of a two-part tutorial that is prepared as part of the Machine learning course that I teach in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Nazarbayev University. The purpose of the first part of this tutorial (the current notebook) is to provide a quick introduction to students who have no knowledge of Python programming but are familar with programming principles in another object oriented language; for example, they know what loops are used for or what the purpose of conditional statements is, or why we need functions, what is in general a class (a recipe for creating an object), object (instance of a class), method (the action that the object can perform), and attributes (properties of class or objects). I have tried to make the tutorial as self-contained as possible. In this regard, the students will start from the very basics in Python and work their way up to advanced topics in Python. In the second part of this tutorial, I will cover three important Python packages that are very useful for data wrangling and analysis. Therein, I specially focus on NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib. At the end of this two-part tutorial what students need is a good sense of programming that along with a search engine can do anything they want in Python. \n",

This is why Python is known as  being *dynamically-typed*; that is, we do not need to declare variables like what is done in C (no need to specify their types) or even they do not need to always refer to the objects of the same type (and in Python *everything* is an object). This is itself a consequence of the fact that *Python variables are pointers*! In Python, an assignment statement such as x = 1, creates a pointer x that points to a memory location storing object 4 (yes, even numbers are objects!). At the same, types are attached to the objects on the right, not to the variable name on the left. So x could refer to all those values. We can see the type of a variable (the type of what is referring to) by ``type()`` method. For example,"

    "Using ``for`` loop in Python, we can loop over any *iterable* object. What is an iterable Python object? An iterable is any object capable of returning its members one at a time, permitting it to be iterated over in a ``for`` loop. For example, any sequence such as list, string, and tuple, or even non-sequential collections such as sets and dictionaries are iterable objects. To be precise, to loop over some iterable objects, Python creates a special object known as *iterator* (more on this in Section [1.8](#iterators)). So basically when an object is iterable, under the hood Python creates the iterator object and traverses through the elements. The structure of a ``for`` loop is pretty much straightforward in Python: <a id='forloop'></a>"
