# Getting Started with Python

This is the first of a two-part tutorial that is prepared as part of the Machine learning course that I teach in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Nazarbayev University. The purpose of the first part of this tutorial (the current notebook) is to provide a quick introduction to students who have no knowledge of Python programming but are familar with programming principles in another object oriented language; for example, they know what loops are used for or what the purpose of conditional statements is, or why we need functions, what is in general a class (a recipe for creating an object), object (instance of a class), method (the action that the object can perform), and attributes (properties of class or objects). I have tried to make the tutorial as self-contained as possible. In this regard, the students will start from the very basics in Python and work their way up to advanced topics in Python. In the second part of this tutorial, I will cover three important Python packages that are very useful for data wrangling and analysis. Therein, I specially focus on NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib. At the end of this two-part tutorial what students need is a good sense of programming that along with a search engine can do anything they want in Python.
